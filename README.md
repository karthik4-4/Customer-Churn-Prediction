🏦 Customer Churn Prediction (Bank)

This project is based on predicting customer churn using Deep Learning.
The main focus is not on model performance, but on understanding the implementation, analyzing parameters, and visualizing how performance changes with different hyperparameters.

Two models are designed — one with a single hidden layer and another with two hidden layers — to observe how network depth affects training and results.
By experimenting with parameters like activation functions, optimizers, learning rate, and epochs, the project helps understand how each factor impacts model learning and performance visualization.

The aim is to gain a conceptual understanding of building and tuning neural networks in TensorFlow/Keras for customer churn prediction in banking.
