# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning, aiming to predict whether a customer will stay with or leave the bank. The primary goal is not to build a perfect or production-ready model, but to gain a practical understanding of how deep learning models are developed and to experience the overall modeling process.
